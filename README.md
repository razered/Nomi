## Portfolio

Created using Jekyll and GitHub Pages by referring to [this](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) guide. 

**Tip** : If you want to get something up and ready quickly to showcase skills to an employer - start from someone else's open source website and modify it to your taste. 
I started with [this](https://maxchadwick.xyz/) source and simplified it.
